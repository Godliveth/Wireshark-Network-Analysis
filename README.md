# Wireshark-Network Traffic-Analysis 
My Wireshark traffic analysis project documenting ICMP, TCP, UDP, DNS, and HTTP captures.


## ðŸ“˜ Project Overview
Hands-on packet analysis using **Wireshark** on **Kali Linux** to explore and understand how core network protocols behave across different communication layers.

This project demonstrates how a SOC Analyst can use Wireshark to gain visibility into:
- **Normal network behavior**
- **Reconnaissance indicators**
- **Protocol-specific anomalies**

---

## ðŸ§¾ Project Summary
As part of my SOC Analyst training, I captured and analyzed real network traffic to study how data flows through various protocols including **ARP, DNS, ICMP, TCP, UDP, and HTTP**.  
Each protocol was interpreted with a focus on **SOC relevance** â€” understanding what normal traffic looks like and what could indicate a potential security event.

## ðŸ§  About this Project
This project represents five days of focused learning and experimentation with Wireshark on Kali Linux.  
I performed and documented:
- Packet captures and inspections of common protocols  
- Identification of key flags, request types, and communication patterns  
- Mapping of network activity to potential security events (e.g., ARP spoofing, DNS tunneling, SYN scans)

The exercise strengthened my understanding of **network packet behavior**, **traffic analysis**, and **SOC monitoring fundamentals**.

## ðŸ§© Key Learnings
- Recognizing how **TCP flags** indicate connection states  
- Using **DNS and ICMP traffic** for recon detection  
- Observing **HTTP headers** for possible data exfiltration  
- Differentiating between **normal** and **suspicious** traffic patterns  
- Gaining hands-on comfort with **Wireshark filters** and analysis
